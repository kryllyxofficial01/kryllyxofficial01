### About Me:
I'm an aspiring computer engineer studying at Purdue University (class of 2029), with a strong interest in low-level development and integrated circuits. My main programming language for hobby projects is usually C, but I am also proficient in C++, Python, and Java. And following a full four years in FIRST robotics, I was able to garner skills in the design, construction, and implementation of robotics systems (namely the electronic wiring and programming of them).
